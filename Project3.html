    How many ways do people celebrate the joy of Victory Day? On such a glorious day of the country, the entire nation rejoices. Many try to do something exceptional to give this day a different atmosphere. Now, with that thought in mind, a Bangladeshi pilot named Fahim Chowdhury from the United States showed how deep the patriotism of the conquered nation is.
    Capturing the spirit of victory, this pilot created a route map of Bangladesh in the sky. He showed the world a unique way of loving the country.  

 
On Saturday (December 14) at 11:16 pm local time, Fahim took off from Republic Airport in New York and mapped out a route map of Bangladesh in the sky. Later, it spread to people in different parts of the world. Fahim shared this news on his Facebook account. 
 
He flew 290 nautical miles, drawing a picture-like map of Bangladesh in the sky of New York, which can be seen on aviation radar. For this, he had to fly in the sky for 2 hours and 38 minutes.
 
Fahim, who lives in the United States, is currently training in the United States for a commercial pilot license. He earned his private pilot license from Galaxy Flying Academy in Bangladesh.
